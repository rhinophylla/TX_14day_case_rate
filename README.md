This project grew out of my need to have a metric to help my family decide if our kids should participate in virtual or in-person school during the 2020 school year.  I read that one of the metrics California was using to decide if counties would be able to hold in-person school was the 14 day COVID case rate per 100,000 residents.  A case rate under 100 is considered favorable.  I wrote a Python program that calculates this metric for each county in Texas as well as the state as a whole using data on cumulative COVID cases downloaded from the Texas Department of Health Services website. The results are output as a .csv file which I then used to create a Tableau visualization hosted here:

Users can select various Texas counties of interest to display within the viz.
